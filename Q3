(a) LINEAR TIME LOGIC
Since the array is sorted and contains numbers from 1 to n, each element should satisfy
arr[i] = i + 1
in a complete array.
Traverse the array from index 0 to n-2.
For each index i:
If arr[i] ≠ i + 1, then the missing number is i + 1.
If no mismatch is found in the entire array, then the missing number is n (the last number).

(b) LOGIC USING BINARY SEARCH
Set low = 0, high = n − 2.
While low ≤ high:
Compute mid = (low + high) / 2.
Check the expected value at mid: it should be mid + 1.
If arr[mid] = mid + 1, the missing number is in the right half, so set
low = mid + 1.
Otherwise, the missing number is in the left half, so set
high = mid − 1.
When the loop ends, low will point to the index where the mismatch begins.
The missing number is low + 1.
